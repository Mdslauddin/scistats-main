def harmmean():
    """
    Return the harmonic mean of data.

    The harmonic mean, sometimes called the subcontrary mean, is the
    reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of the data,
    and is often appropriate when averaging quantities which are rates
    or ratios, for example speeds. Example:

    Suppose an investor purchases an equal value of shares in each of
    three companies, with P/E (price/earning) ratios of 2.5, 3 and 10.
    What is the average P/E ratio for the investor's portfolio?

    >>> harmonic_mean([2.5, 3, 10])  # For an equal investment portfolio.
    3.6

    Using the arithmetic mean would give an average of about 5.167, which
    is too high.

    If ``data`` is empty, or any element is less than zero,
    ``harmonic_mean`` will raise ``StatisticsError``.

    Convert data to floats and compute the geometric mean.

    Raises a StatisticsError if the input dataset is empty,
    if it contains a zero, or if it contains a negative value.

    No special efforts are made to achieve exact results.
    (However, this may change in the future.)
